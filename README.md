# `Air Quality` (HVAC) Monitoring Web App

<!-- <hr> -->

This repository contains the website created to display the content of <u>real-time</u> HVAC <i>(Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning)</i> data monitoring.

## Description
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This was created for the project under the course `(BCSE313L) Fog and Edge Computing` at VIT-Chennai.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Website provides a responsive dashboard for visual representation of the previously-recorded and real-time data collected using the sensors and other hardware components.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As a pre-requisite for the project under subject, ths project follows C2F2T and its reverse model as explained in subsequent section.

## Project Overview

   * **Data Collection:**  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Data is collected by using various sensors such as MQ-series sensors, DHT-11, and flame sensors.  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        An Arduino periodically reads the data from these sensors.

   *  **Data Passage:**  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Data collected from the sensors by Arduino is passed to the Raspberry-Pi using serial communication at appropriate baud-rate.

   * **Data Filtering and Display:**  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        The Raspberry Pi splits, filters, and processes the received data locally.  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Weather predictions are fetched using an API for the day and night at the specified location.  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Based on the latest locally received data and online predictions, display graphics are generated and updated on an the LCD-TFT display.  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Further, the data is passed to the cloud for storage and further access.

   * **Data Storage:**  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        Firebase, a NoSQL database, is utilized to create, retrieve, and update data.  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        The data received in this series is stored under specific firebase nodes.

   * **Web Interface:**  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        A fully functional and responsive website is created and deployed on vercel.  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        The website fetches data from the cloud, and its components are updated periodically.  
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        The website also features an Emergency Alert System, which can be a lifesaver in cases of fire or gas leakage in the monitored area.
